Alice needs at least 4 experiments:

1,2,6
1,3,4
1,2,5
1,3,5



Explanation: We will show the only common color among the 4 experiments is the 1-gram balloon. The identity of the other ballons would remain undetermined.

First we write down all possible triplets of balloons that do not lift the weight
1,2,3
1,2,4
1,2,5
1,2,6
1,3,4
1,3,5
2,3,4

Given the 4 experiments shown by Alice, the perspective from Bob is
a,b,c | a,d,e | a,b,f | a,d,f

Notice here 6 colors are shown to Bob in these 4 experiments, and in each experiment there are 3 balloons. Because there are only 6 balloons in all possible triples, [a-f] must correspond to [1-6] in some order. In particular, the 6-gram balloon must exist.

Since 6 only appears once in "1,2,6" among all triplets, repetitive colors from the experiments cannot be 6. Therefore c = 6 or e = 6. WOLOG we assume c = 6 because the problem is symmetric under (b,c) <-> (d,e).

It remains to show a != 2. Suppose it is, then a = 2, b = 1, c = 6. Because "a,d,e" is among the triplets we must have [de] = [34], making the last undetermined balloon f = 5. However, looking at "a,d,f", we see neither d = 3 nor d = 4 would work. This contradiction shows a != 2.

Therefore the only possibility is a = 1.
